                CÔTE OUEST is an African independent company leader of the distribution of audio-visual It operates since 1993 and relies on a network of 71 employees spread out over the whole continent. Even if the main CÔTE OUEST headquarters are Abidjan (Côte d’Ivoire), the company is also present in Ebène (Mauritius) and Johannesburg (South Africa).
                <br>
                
                With the creation of CÔTE OUEST, Bernard Azria, one of the best marketing and communication specialist in French speaking Africa, paved the way to a new business sector still non-existentat the time in the region. He then was the pioneer of this sector on the continent.

                <img width="250" class="float-left img-fluid rounded mr-2" src="%img_path%" alt="cote ouest audiovisuel. a propos de nous">

                Today CÔTE OUEST distributes annually almost 20 000 hours of programs to more than 100 clients, publishers of on - and offline services who, thanks to the current distribution platforms, have access to 63 main markets and for some of them the whole world. If historically, the activity of CÔTE OUEST started with the distribution over Sub-Saharan French speaking Africa of contents from a number of Hollywood Majors such asSPTI, MGM, TWDC and CBS, CÔTE OUESTquickly expanded its activityover the whole of French speaking Africa, France and the French overseas departments and territories. 
            </p>

            <p>
                Betting on a warm welcome of the south Americantelenovelas, COTE OUEST was there again the pioneer in introducing these shows to theses territories, thus creating a real TV phenomenon if not a social phenomenon that still lasts to these days.This lead the company as early as 1999 to sign an exclusive distribution deal in French- and English-speaking Africa and French overseas departments and territories with the giant Globo TV International. This agreement has by the way been renewed to give COTE OUEST Globo’s distribution rights until 2033.
            </p>

            <p>
                In parallel, COTE OUEST has progressively extended its activity to the English-speaking market.On this market the company is setting itself more and more as a main player.
            </p>

            <p>
               At the dawn of the Noughties, COTE OUEST took note of the increasing demand of the televiewers for African content, and, a pioneer once again, patiently and systematically built the most important African catalogue on the market. This catalogue, the first of its kind, holds programs from every part of the continent.
            </p> 

            <p>
                Some titles are distributed in theiroriginal versions, be it French, English ou Angolan. 
            </p>

            <p>
                COTE OUEST also provides the dubbing of the best ones to be able to distribute them out of the original regions, thus creating the first step in what COTE OUEST calls « Cross Fertilization », that is to allow neighbouring populations to watch neighbouring programs. Here again, COTE OUEST was a trailblazer with « L’histoire d’une vie », dubbed from French to English and distributed in 14 English speaking countries, with « Jacob Cross » dubbed for English to French and distributed in 45 French speaking countries, with « Windeck » dubbed from Portuguese to French and English to be distributed in 77 pays including 40 French speaking and 37 English speaking countries. Rich of almost 20 000 hours COTE OUEST’s catalogue includes every genre: series, movies, documentaries, animations etc., mainly from Africa (or rather the Africas), from South America and some Hollywood blockbusters too.

            International audiences' yearning for original content are turning to new markets from the South Hemisphere. We believe that great potential lies within the collaboration of the "South". A partnership that has yet to be truly developed. As a distributor, the added value brought by CÔTE OUEST is to get off the beaten track and offer new opportunities that have yet to be tapped into. As such, and thanks to our expert assessment of the South American, African and Australian markets, we are able to position ourselves as a provider of content from the South.

                Whether it is in art, literature, music, in every domain, Africaabounds with talents and gave a lot of these talents to the world. Africa deserves a much better place in the concert of nations and we think it’s time for these talents to serve the dreams and ambitions of Africa. It’s Time For Africa!
            </p>

            <p>
                Indeed, we believe the time has come for African people to tell their own stories. We believe the African creativity deserves a better place on the international scene. We are convinced the African production can travel through and beyond geographical borders of its continent. We love with a passion the singularity of each of these Africas of which visible and invisible frontiers go far beyond those of the continent.We know to which extent theses Africas are beautiful, rich and coloured and we have the major ambition to unite these flaming colours in one and only offer.

            <p>
                Africa is also a diaspora of more than 200 million peopledistributed over the four corners of the planet. This diaspora is hungry for African content.The African audio-visual industry’s dynamism allowed and still allows the creation of quality works which can now claim their place in international TV programming.
            </p>
            

            <p>
                Our ambition is therefore to carry Africa beyond its borders. Beyond this though we believe the future of humanity lies in its cultural mix and we are fervent supporters of a multicultural approach of entertainment. Equally we are convinced a large potential remains hidden in South-South cooperation, still largely untapped.
            </p>

            <p>
                Our will is then to get off the beaten track and to offer new still not much explored paths.So, thanks to its expertise on the Latin America, Africa and now Australia and the CaribbeanCOTE OUEST is now best positioned as a content provider from the South.
